We study complex systems and their origins, working among microbiology, biophysics, synthetic biology and evolutionary biology. Roughly half of us work, at the moment, on the bacterial flagellar motor. We use this as a model molecular complex to explore protein engineering, directed and experimental evolution, and to understand better how bacterial swimming has evolved and how we can push it to do new things.

Roughly the other half of us work on 'bottom-up' synthetic biology where we try to use insights gleaned from understanding an ancient molecular complex (the motor) to build new nanotechnologies out of simple lipid and DNA components to see how we can increase the complexity step-by-step to create new tools in biosensing and light-activation.

We welcome applications to join our group and have spaces for PhD applicants and postdocs where suitable. Please contact [Matt](https://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/matthew-baker) if you are interested in joining or collaborating.
