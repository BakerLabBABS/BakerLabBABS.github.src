##### Matt Baker
![MattHead](images/MattWide.jpg)
Matt completed his DPhil at Oxford University studying the molecular motor that makes many bacteria swim and that is where he first learned to love microbiology where you could work with complex living systems but also put them 'on ice' when you needed to. Matt started this group at BABS in 2018, and has a love of radio.
